### 🧠 General Advice (Before Starting a New Game)

Half-Life isn’t just about shooting but also about problem-solving and exploration. Conserve ammo by aiming carefully and using the crowbar whenever possible, since resources can be scarce. Listen to NPC dialogue and environmental cues, as they often hint at where to go or what to do next. Keep moving and use cover during fights instead of tanking damage, and don’t forget to save often; you never know what’s waiting around the corner.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running Half-Life on PCSX2, make sure you’re using the latest **stable** build for stability and better compatibility; set the renderer to Direct3D11/12 (Hardware) for smooth visuals, but switch to Software mode if you notice missing textures.

    🏆 Progression <i><sub><sup>(1 achievements - 1 points)</sup></sub></i>

Half-Life is very linear, but it rewards careful observation; each chapter flows naturally, with environmental cues and scripted events guiding you forward, so pay close attention to where NPCs move, noises you hear, or doors that suddenly unlock.

Some challenges you'll face in Half-Life include scarce resources, tough enemy encounters, and tricky navigation. Ammo and health don’t come in abundance, so you'll need to conserve bullets by aiming carefully and relying on your crowbar for weaker foes.
